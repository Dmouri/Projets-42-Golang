# # Gomoku
If you are on Windows you can directly use the .exe inside the directory gomoku-1.0.0

If you are on OSX :
- You must have Go installed
- run `make goget` to fetch dependencies
- run `make`
- `./gomoku`

There is a minor issue with the sound quality with Windows but it works good on OSX.
