Here is some projects of the 42 school written in Golang.
In each directory you will find the subject of the project and a README describing the program and its dependencies.


# Gomoku

Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. It is a 2 player game.
Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Rules on this project has been modified from the classic game to make it harder to win.

# Computer v1

Computer v1 is a program that solves quadratic equation.

# Expert system


In artificial intelligence, an expert system is a computer system emulating the decision-making ability of a human expert. Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as if-then rules rather than through conventional procedural code.
Here it is making decision on propositional calculus which is a branch of logic. It deals with propositions (which can be true or false) and relations between propositions, including the construction of arguments based on them.
